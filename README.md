**Project Overview**

This project focuses on improving embryo implantation success rates for an IVF and ART clinic.

Currently, embryo grading is manual, subjective, and time-consuming. The goal is to develop a data-driven, AI-powered solution using deep learning to classify embryo images objectively and enhance fertility outcomes.

**Business Problem**

Manual embryo grading leads to inconsistent results and inefficiencies in the ART process.

**Proposed Solution**

Implement a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) to automatically classify embryo images based on quality, reducing human bias and improving decision accuracy.

**Objectives**

* Increase the success rate of ART procedures.

* Automate embryo quality assessment using AI.

Success Criteria

* Business: Improve ART success rate by at least 10%.

* Economic: Achieve 25% cost savings by minimizing work on low-quality embryos.

* Constraint: Reduce overall treatment cost while maintaining accuracy.
